`this` doesn't always mean the current object- it's actually determined by how a function is called, not where it's written.
✅ Key takeaway for regular functions:
this is not lexical in normal functions — it’s dynamic.

Here’s the one-line trick to instantly figure out this in any *** regular function call *** :
*** Look to the left of the dot when the function is called — that’s your this.
*** The object that actually calls the function decides what this will be inside that function.
*** If there’s no dot, this is the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
📌 Rule of thumb:
In regular functions, this is not fixed — it’s assigned at the moment the function is called, and the “assigner” is whoever is doing the calling.


✅ Key takeaway for arrow functions:
Arrow functions don’t have their own this.
In arrow functions, this is lexical — taken from the surrounding scope.
(Arrow functions capture this from their parent scope)
Arrow functions are the rebel children — they ignore this rule and just take this from where they were created/written

1️⃣ Global Context
Outside of any function:
console.log(this); 

In a browser: this → window object.
In Node.js: this → {} (empty object in modules).
---
2️⃣ Inside a Regular Function
The value of this depends on the caller:
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}
// Look to the left of the dot when the function is called 
showThis();         // In non-strict mode: global object (window)
                    // In strict mode: undefined
---
3️⃣ Inside an Object Method
When called as an object’s property, this → that object.
const person = {
  name: "Pavan",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
// Look to the left of the dot when the function is called 
person.greet(); // "Pavan"

Example 1 — Same function, different callers
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}
const obj1 = { name: "Obj1", show: showThis };
const obj2 = { name: "Obj2", show: showThis };

// Calling through obj1
obj1.show(); // `this` is obj1 → { name: "Obj1", show: f }

// Calling through obj2
obj2.show(); // `this` is obj2 → { name: "Obj2", show: f }

// Calling directly
showThis(); // `this` is window (or undefined in strict mode)
💡 The same showThis function is reused, but the value of this changes based on who calls it.

Example 2 — Losing the caller
const person = {
  name: "Pavan",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
person.greet(); // "Pavan"  (caller is `person`)
const fn = person.greet;
fn(); // undefined or error (caller is now global object)
Here, when fn() runs, it’s no longer called through person, so this loses its link to that object.

Event Handlers
this is usually set to the element that received the event.
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // The <button> element
});
---
Explicit Binding
We can control this with:
.call(thisArg, ...args)
.apply(thisArg, [args])
.bind(thisArg)

function greet() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const obj = { name: "Pavan" };
greet.call(obj);  // "Pavan"
greet.apply(obj); // "Pavan"

const bound = greet.bind(obj);
bound();          // "Pavan"

More examples:
1. Dot present → this is the object before the dot
const car = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  start: function() {
    console.log(this.brand);
  }
};

car.start(); // "Tesla"  ← left of dot = car

2. No dot → global object (or undefined in strict mode)
function showBrand() {
  console.log(this.brand);
}
showBrand(); // undefined (strict mode) OR window.brand (non-strict)

3. Chained dots → the immediate left counts
const garage = {
  car: {
    brand: "BMW",
    start: function() {
      console.log(this.brand);
    }
  }
};

garage.car.start(); // "BMW" ← left of dot is `garage.car`

4. Call stored in a variable → loses caller info
const bike = {
  brand: "Yamaha",
  start: function() {
    console.log(this.brand);
  }
};

const startBike = bike.start;
startBike(); // undefined → no left-of-dot
