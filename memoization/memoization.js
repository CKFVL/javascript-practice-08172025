Memoization in JavaScript
Memoization is an optimization technique where you cache the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

It’s commonly used for:

Recursive algorithms (Fibonacci, factorial)

Heavy computation functions

Avoiding repeated API or database calls
