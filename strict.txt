-	Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
-	It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
-	Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.

How to use strict mode:
Strict mode can be used in two ways – used in global scope for the entire script and can be applied to individual functions. Strict mode doesn’t work with block statements enclosed in {} braces.

Examples of using Strict mode:
// Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
'use strict'; 
 x = 3.14;
 console.log(x)
 
// Objects are variables too. 
// Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed: 
x = {p1:10, p2:20}; // will throw an error 
 console.log(x)
 
 // Deleting a function is also not allowed 
 Note: variables should not be deleted.
