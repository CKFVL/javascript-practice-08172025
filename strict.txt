-	Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
-	It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
-	Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.

How to use strict mode:
Strict mode can be used in two ways 
  – used in global scope for the entire script (i.e., at the top of the script)
      use strict";
      x = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError
  - and can be applied to individual functions.
      function test() {
        "use strict";
          y = 20; // ❌ ReferenceError
      }

Strict mode doesn’t work with block statements enclosed in {} braces.
     {
        "use strict";
        z = 30; // ✅ No error
     }

Examples of using Strict mode:
// Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
'use strict'; 
 x = 3.14;
 console.log(x)
 
// Objects are variables too. 
// Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed: 
x = {p1:10, p2:20}; // will throw an error 
 console.log(x)
 
 // Deleting a function is also not allowed 
 Note: variables should not be deleted.
 
######
ES Modules are always strict
If you’re using:
  type="module"
    or:
  import/export

Then strict mode is automatically enabled — no need to add "use strict".
