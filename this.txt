// rule of thumb:
// this : object that is executing the current function
// if a function is a method in an Object, this refers to object itself
// if a function is regular function i.e., not inside an object, this refers to global object
//      in strict mode, global object can't be accessed inside a function using this
// if a function is constructor function and is created using new operator, then this refers to arguments to it in new {} object
